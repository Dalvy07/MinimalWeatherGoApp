# Ideally, i would need to create a HEALTHCHECK, but that would significantly increase the image size
# The whole point is that GO allows using completely bare scratch for running, as it compiles to a binary
# And to create a HEALTHCHECK, you need some curl or something similar that requires a package manager and file system

# Run the application
